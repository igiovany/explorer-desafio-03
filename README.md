### Rocketseat Explorer - Stage 03 Challenge

A blog aimed at practice and application of css and html concepts and tools like `mobile first`, `grid layout`, `animations`, `css variables`, `HSL colors`, `flexible measurement unit`.

The major challenge in this project was use `grid-template-areas`, a property that wasn't used in classes.
